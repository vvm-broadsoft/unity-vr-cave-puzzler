## Hint
After entering the cave, another text gives a hint about what player should do.
In our case, player should play Simon Says game with crystals.
The text gives a hint that crystals are representing a puzzle and that player can interact with them, but does not give a clue how to solve it.
Clicking OKAY will start the puzzle.
