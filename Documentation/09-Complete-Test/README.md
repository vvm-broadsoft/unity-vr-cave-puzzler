# User Test of Completed Game
At this stage, the game is almost completed and this is the final user test.

### 1. How do you think does the sound matches to the atmosphere outside the cave?
It's OK

### 2. When you'll click on the cave, you will be moved inside. This may cause discomfort, so if you feel bad, just take off the cardboard. How comfortable was the movement? Do you want to make it slower or faster?
It was comfortable, but I would make it slower

### 3. How do you think the sound matches to the atmosphere inside the case?
It's good

### 4. Before starting the puzzle, what do you think the puzzle is?
Do something with crystals, maybe reorder them, or just click

### 5. Now please start the puzzle. How hard it was to understand the meaning of the puzzle and solve it?
Easy (player managed to solve the puzzle from the first try)

### 6. What have you noticed after solving the puzzle?
Nice music played and the stone moved

### 7. What do you want to do after solving the puzzle
Exit the cave

### 8. What would you improve in the game (sound, movement, game mechanics)?
Everything looks good.
But it would be nice to align the last UI panel better.

### 9. Would you show such game to your mum? :)
Definitely
