# Scene user test

## 1. How big or small do you feel? How big or small is the cave?
 1.1. For myself, I'm feeling normal size, nor too big nor too small.

 1.2. When standing in front of the cave, it seems that the cave top is on the same level as my nose, so I need to duck to enter the case

 1.3. Inside the cave, sizes seem natural. The cave is rather long.

## 2. How comfortable is to look around and look at various objects? Do you need to stretch to see something, or is anything hard to concentrate on or uncomfortable to look at?
 2.1. There's a feeling that a part of the far mountains that located on the right side of the cave and have only black silhouette are very close. Other mountains that are more detailed they look ok.

 2.2. Crystals do not look attached to the wall, like flying in the air. There's no connection to wall or any shadows from them.

## 3. What atmosphere and mood you feel in this scene, outside and inside the cave?
 3.1. It rather realistic and scary that you can fall off the cliff

 3.2. Inside the cave, it seems that the cliff end starts right after the cave entry, so it is still scary and uncomfortable

 2.2. Re-positioned crystals, added stone "substrate" for them, and changed materials and lighting to get better shadows and reflections
