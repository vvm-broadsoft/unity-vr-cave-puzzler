# Reflections on user feedback
 1-7. OK

 8-9. I want to activate puzzle only after player acknowledges the text on the panel, so the panel button will actually start puzzle sequence. The text should be changed to make this more clear

 10-11. Fixed the position of panel

 12-13. OK

 14. Aligned 1st and 3rd panels to have same distance from the camera as the 2nd one

## Changes
