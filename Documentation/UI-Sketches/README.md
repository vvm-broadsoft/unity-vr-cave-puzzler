# UI Sketches
UI will be pretty simple.
As I decided to make game with some small story, there will be 3 popups filled with text.

## Start
Player stands in front of the cave and should read the input story.

## In the Cave
Player entered into the cave, it's time to set some expectetions about what she might need to do with the puzzle.
Pressing the button will also start the puzzle.
