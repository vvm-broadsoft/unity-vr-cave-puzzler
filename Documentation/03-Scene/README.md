## In the cave
Straight view. Player sees that the way is blocked.

## Crystals
These will be involved in the puzzle, they are placed on the right.
Player should easily see them because of the light coming from crystals.
This light is visible a bit from the outside too.
There will be additional wording in UI to make player inspect the cave, too.
